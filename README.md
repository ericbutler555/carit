# CARIT Website Assignment

Live demo site: [https://ericbutler555.github.io/carit/](https://ericbutler555.github.io/carit/)

This is a fake website project assigned to me for my IT 3203 "Intro to Web Development" course at Kennesaw State University in July 2022.

Plain JavaScript is used to handle some calculations and conditional logic when the user submits a form on the [Apply page](https://ericbutler555.github.io/carit/apply.html).

It uses a decent amount of Flexbox to solve some layout choices, and adapts for responsive design and mobile layouts.
